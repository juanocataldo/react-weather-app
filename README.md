# My first React App

I did this app while i was learning React in 'Henry' bootcamp. It's an app to search city weathers.

## Want to try it?
Clone it, open it in VS Code, run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies and then 'npm start'.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
